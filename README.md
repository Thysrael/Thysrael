## Hi there, I'm Thysrael 👋

### 🖥️ Before the Screen

I am currently a student at **SJTU IPADS Lab**. 
I am fascinated by the "magic" that happens below the abstract layer and dedicated to building better systems software.

I am also a firm believer in the open-source philosophy.

### 🧩 Away from the keyboard

I am a big fan of *[Tales of Tarsylia（塔希里亚故事集）](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Tarsylia)*, which my handle **"Thysrael"** comes from.

I enjoy hands-on hobbies like jigsaw puzzles, blocks, and Gunpla. 
I stick to 'straight-builds' (素组) since painting isn't really my strong suit.


### ✍️ Writing & Thinking

I believe writing is the best way to consolidate knowledge.

* Check out my **[Blog](https://thysrael.github.io/)** for technical deep-dives and travel stories.
* Explore my **[Wiki](https://thysrael.github.io/obsidian-quartz/)**, a living "Digital Garden" where I nurture my daily thoughts and notes.
